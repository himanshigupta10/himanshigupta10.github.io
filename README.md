In this project, I have made a website which is based on Frontend Development. This website is an urge to resolve the very hot issue of our country that is TRAFFIC MANAGEMENT. 
In this, there is a different concerned authority for every cause (like road damage, due to the large vehicles, accidents, etc ) of Traffic jam. This will create more employment opportunities and time-effective, the jam will be cleared quickly.
There will be GPS location tracker on the website which will help admin to trace the location of the place where Traffic  Jam occurred.
Many more things which I am still implementing to pave the way for the success of this project.
